B&B|Builder Company project

This project demonstrates my knowleges in
1. Javascript
2. Node.js
3. Mysql (mysql2 module)
4. Autorisation (passport module)
5. And another less important

For using project first of all run your SQL server, create db **goodsdb**

You can create empty table via `node CreateDB.js` or use table with my data
after importing it from `goodsdb.sql`

At the next step launch server by `node server.js`
before this you can configure some values in `settings.js`

Admin access is on `url/admin/login`

Base settings: 
* login: ***1234***
* password: ***1234***

Also config mail account for email sending

IMPORTANT! SOME OF LOADED MODULES WERE CHANGED (I've fixed this bad practice in my next projects)

DO NOT REINSTALL SOME MODULES

USE THIS PROJECT WITH IT'S OWN FILES FOR CORRECT WORK
